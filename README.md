# Trivia Explorer

This is the source code for my Trivia Explorer project

Trivia Explorer is a web-based trivia question browser and quiz application that allows users to explore, filter, search, and save trivia questions from the [Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB)](https://opentdb.com). I created this website as part of a school assignment.

## Deployment

This website is currently deployed on [Render](https://render.com) and you can view it **[here!](https://triviaexplorer-frontend.onrender.com)** (note that there may be some cold start time for the backend api)

## What did I use?

The "stack" I chose was:

- Frontend: Vanilla html, js, css - using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) elements
- Backend: Express.js server running on node, serving as a cache for OpenTDB

Please give it it try!
